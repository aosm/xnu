/*! @class IOService : public IORegistryEntry
    @abstract The base class for most families, devices and drivers.
    @discussion The IOService base class defines APIs used to publish services, instantiate other services based on the existance of a providing service (ie. driver stacking), destroy a service and its dependent stack, notify interested parties of service state changes, and general utility functions useful across all families. 

Types of service are specified with a matching dictionary that describes properties of the service. For example, a matching dictionary might describe any IOUSBDevice (or subclass), an IOUSBDevice with a certain class code, or a IOPCIDevice with a set of OpenFirmware matching names or device & vendor IDs. Since the matching dictionary is interpreted by the family which created the service, as well as generically by IOService, the list of properties considered for matching depends on the familiy.

Matching dictionaries are associated with IOService classes by the catalogue, as driver property tables, and also supplied by clients of the notification APIs.

IOService provides matching based on c++ class (via OSMetaClass dynamic casting), registry entry name, a registry path to the service (which includes OpenFirmware paths), a name assigned by BSD, or by its location (its point of attachment).

<br><br>Driver Instantiation by IOService<br><br>

Drivers are subclasses of IOService, and their availability is managed through the catalogue. They are instantiated based on the publication of an IOService they use (for example, an IOPCIDevice or IOUSBDevice), or when they are added to  the catalogue and the IOService(s) they use are already available.

When an IOService (the "provider") is published with the registerService() method, the matching and probing process begins, which is always single threaded per provider. A list of matching dictionaries from the catalog and installed publish notification requests, that successfully match the IOService, is constructed, with ordering supplied by kIOProbeScoreKey ("IOProbeScore") property in the dictionary, or supplied with the notification. 

Each entry in the list is then processed in order - for notifications, the notification is delivered, for driver property tables a lot more happens.

The driver class is instantiated and init() called with its property table. The new driver instance is then attached to the provider, and has its probe() method called with the provider as an argument. The default probe method does nothing but return success, but a driver may implement this method to interrogate the provider to make sure it can work with it. It may also modify its probe score at this time. After probe, the driver is detached and the next in the list is considered (ie. attached, probed, and detached).

When the probing phase is complete, the list consists of successfully probed drivers, in order of their probe score (after adjustment during the probe() call). The list is then divided into categories based on the kIOMatchCategoryKey property ("IOMatchCategory"); drivers without a match category are all considered in one default category. Match categories allow multiple clients of a provider to be attached and started, though the provider may also enforce open/close semantics to gain active access to it.

For each category, the highest scoring driver in that category is attached to the provider, and its start() method called. If start() is successful, the rest of the drivers in the same match category are discarded, otherwise the next highest scoring driver is started, and so one.

The driver should only consider itself in action when the start method is called, meaning it has been selected for use on the provider, and consuming that particular match category. It should also be prepared to be allocated, probed and freed even if the probe was sucessful.

After the drivers have all synchronously been started, the installed "matched" notifications that match the registered IOService are delivered.

<br><br>Properties used by IOService<br><br>

	kIOClassKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIOClassKey, "IOClass"
<br>
Class of the driver to instantiate on matching providers.
<br>
<br>
	kIOProviderClassKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIOProviderClassKey, "IOProviderClass"
<br>
Class of the provider(s) to be considered for matching, checked with OSDynamicCast so subclasses will also match.
<br>
<br>
	kIOProbeScoreKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIOProbeScoreKey, "IOProbeScore"
<br>
The probe score initially used to order multiple matching drivers.
<br>
<br>
	kIOMatchCategoryKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIOMatchCategoryKey, "IOMatchCategory"
<br>
A string defining the driver category for matching purposes. All drivers with no IOMatchCategory property are considered to be in the same default category. Only one driver in a category can be started on each provider.
<br>
<br>
	kIONameMatchKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIONameMatchKey, "IONameMatch"
<br>
A string or collection of strings that match the provider's name. The comparison is implemented with the IORegistryEntry::compareNames method, which supports a single string, or any collection (OSArray, OSSet, OSDictionary etc.) of strings. IOService objects with OpenFirmware device tree properties (eg. IOPCIDevice) will also be matched based on that standard's "compatible", "name", "device_type" properties. The matching name will be left in the driver's property table in the kIONameMatchedKey property.
<br>
Examples
<br>
      &ltkey&gtIONameMatch&lt/key&gt		<br>
	&ltstring&gtpci106b,7&ltstring&gt
<br>
For a list of possible matching names, a serialized array of strings should used, eg.
<br>
      &ltkey&gtIONameMatch&lt/key&gt		<br>
	&ltarray&gt				<br>
		&ltstring&gtAPPL,happy16&lt/string&gt	<br>
		&ltstring&gtpci106b,7&lt/string&gt	<br>
	&lt/array&gt
<br>
<br>
	kIONameMatchedKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIONameMatchedKey, "IONameMatched"
<br>
The name successfully matched name from the kIONameMatchKey property will be left in the driver's property table as the kIONameMatchedKey property.
<br>
<br>
	kIOPropertyMatchKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIOPropertyMatchKey, "IOPropertyMatch"
<br>
A dictionary of properties that each must exist in the matching IOService and compare sucessfully with the isEqualTo method.
      &ltkey&gtIOPropertyMatch&lt/key&gt		<br>
	&ltdictionary&gt				<br>
		&ltkey&gtname&lt/key&gt	<br>
		&ltstring&gtAPPL,meek8&lt/string&gt	<br>
	&lt/dictionary&gt
<br>
<br>
	kIOUserClientClassKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIOUserClientClassKey, "IOUserClientClass"
<br>
The class name that the service will attempt to allocate when a user client connection is requested.  First the device nub is queried, then the nub's provider is queried by default.
<br>
<br>
	kIOKitDebugKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIOKitDebugKey, "IOKitDebug"
<br>
Set some debug flags for logging the driver loading process. Flags are defined in IOKit/IOKitDebug.h, but 65535 works well.

If the kIOServiceRequired flag is passed however, terminate will be sucessful though further progress in the destruction of the IOService will not proceed until the last client has closed it. The service will be made inactive immediately upon successful termination, and all its clients will be notified via their message method with a message of type kIOMessageServiceIsTerminated. Both these actions take place on the callers thread. After the IOService is made inactive, further matching or attach calls will fail on it. Each client has its stop method called upon their close of an inactive IOService, or on its termination if they do not have it open. After stop, detach is called in each client. When all clients have been detached, the finalize method is called in the inactive service. The terminate process is inherently asynchronous since it will be deferred until all clients have chosen to close.

        the power state array of the child (in the inputPowerRequirement field), and
        the parent compares them to bits in the outputPowerCharacter fields of its
        power state array.
        @param whichChild
        This points to the caller, so the power domain can know which child is requesting.
        @param specificationFlags
        This value modifies the parent's choice of power state.
        If the parameter is IOPMNextHigherState, the parent will choose the lowest state
        which matches desiredState and which is higher than the current state.
        If the parameter is IOPMHighestState	, the parent will choose the highest state
        which matches desiredState.
        If the parameter is IOPMNextLowerState, the parent will choose the highest state
        which matches desiredState and which is lower than the current state.
        If the parameter is IOPMLowestState, the parent will choose the lowest state
        which matches desiredState.
        A state matches desiredState if all the bits set in desiredState are also set in the
        outputPowerCharacter field of that state in the parent's power state array.
        @result
        The power domain parent returns IOPMBadSpecification if specificationFlags
        not wellformed.  It returns IOPMNoSuchState if no state in its array satisfies

/*! @function activityTickle
        A principal function of a policy-maker is deciding when the device is idle and can be
        powered down.  To do this it needs to know when the device is being used.  In some
        cases it is in the data path to the device so it knows when it is being used.  In others
        it is not and must be told.  The activityTickle method is provided for objects in the
        system to tell a policy-maker that its device is being used.

        If the policy-maker is managing the idleness determination totally on its own, the
        paramter should be kIOPMSubclassPolicy, and the policy-maker should intercept
        the activityTickle call, because the superclass will do nothing with it.

        The IOService superclass can manage idleness determination, too, with the simple
        mechanism of an idle timer and this activityTickle call.  To start this up, the policy-
        maker calls its superclass at setIdleTimerPeriod.  This starts a timer for the time
        interval specified in the call.  When the timer expires, the superclass checks to see
        if there has been any activity since the last timer expiration. (It checks to see if
        activityTickle has been called).  If there has been activity, it restarts the timer, and
        this process continues.  When the timer expires, and there has been no device
        activity, the superclass lowers the device power state to the next lower state.
        This can continue until the device is in state zero.

        After the device has been powered down by at least one power state,
        a call to activityTickle will cause the device to be switched to a higher state
        required for the activity.

        activityTickle in the IOService superclass is meant to be called by sub-classed
        policy-makers, because only they understand the paramters.  They may implement
        an activityTickle for their clients and then call this activityTickle in the superclass.
        @param type
        activityTickle with parameter kIOPMSubclassPolicy is not handled in IOService
        and should be intercepted by the subclass policy-maker.
        activityTickle with parameter kIOPMSuperclassPolicy1 causes an activity flag to be set,
        and the device state checked.  If the device has been powered down, it is powered up again.
        @param stateNumber
        When the type parameter is kIOPMSuperclassPolicy1, the stateNumber contains
        the desired power state ordinal for the activity.  If the device is in a lower state,
        the superclass will switch it to this state.  This is for devices which can handle
        some accesses in lower power states than others; the device is powered up only
        as far as it needs to be for the activity.
        @result
        When the type parameter is kIOPMSuperclassPolicy1, the superclass returns true
        if the device is currently in the state specified by stateNumber.  If it is in a lower
        state and must be brought up, it returns false.  In this case the superclass will
        cause the device to be brought up. */
