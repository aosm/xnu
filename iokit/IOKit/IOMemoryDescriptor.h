These variants are selected with the options parameter, see below.  This memory descriptor needs to be prepared before it can be used to extract data from the memory described.  However we temporarily have setup a mechanism that automatically prepares kernel_task memory descriptors at creation time.


    @param buffers A pointer to an array of IOVirtualRanges or IOPhysicalRanges if the options:type is Virtual or Physical.  For type UPL it is a upl_t returned by the mach/memory_object_types.h apis, primarily used internally by the UBC.

    @param count options:type = Virtual or Physical count contains a count of the number of entires in the buffers array.  For options:type = UPL this field contains a total length.

    @param offset Only used when options:type = UPL, in which case this field contains an offset for the memory within the buffers upl.

    @param task Only used options:type = Virtual, The task each of the virtual ranges are mapped into.

    @param options
        kIOMemoryDirectionMask (options:direction)	This nibble indicates the I/O direction to be associated with the descriptor, which may affect the operation of the prepare and complete methods on some architectures. 
        kIOMemoryTypeMask (options:type)	kIOMemoryTypeVirtual, kIOMemoryTypePhysical, kIOMemoryTypeUPL Indicates that what type of memory basic memory descriptor to use.  This sub-field also controls the interpretation of the buffers, count, offset & task parameters.
        kIOMemoryAsReference	For options:type = Virtual or Physical this indicate that the memory descriptor need not copy the ranges array into local memory.  This is an optimisation to try to minimise unnecessary allocations.
        kIOMemoryBufferPageable	Only used by the IOBufferMemoryDescriptor as an indication that the kernel virtual memory is in fact pageable and we need to use the kernel pageable submap rather than the default map.
        kIOMemoryNoAutoPrepare	Indicates that the temporary AutoPrepare of kernel_task memory should not be performed.
    
    @param mapper Which IOMapper should be used to map the in-memory physical addresses into I/O space addresses.  Defaults to 0 which indicates that the system mapper is to be used, if present.

    @discussion This is the general purpose method to map all or part of the memory described by a memory descriptor into a task at any available address, or at a fixed address if possible. Caching & read-only options may be set for the mapping. The mapping is represented as a returned reference to a IOMemoryMap object, which may be shared if the mapping is compatible with an existing mapping of the IOMemoryDescriptor. The IOMemoryMap object returned should be released only when the caller has finished accessing the mapping, as freeing the object destroys the mapping. 
    @param intoTask Sets the target task for the mapping. Pass kernel_task for the kernel address space.
    @param atAddress If a placed mapping is requested, atAddress specifies its address, and the kIOMapAnywhere should not be set. Otherwise, atAddress is ignored.
    @param options Mapping options are defined in IOTypes.h,<br>
	kIOMapAnywhere should be passed if the mapping can be created anywhere. If not set, the atAddress parameter sets the location of the mapping, if it is available in the target map.<br>
	kIOMapDefaultCache to inhibit the cache in I/O areas, kIOMapCopybackCache in general purpose RAM.<br>
	kIOMapInhibitCache, kIOMapWriteThruCache, kIOMapCopybackCache to set the appropriate caching.<br>
	kIOMapReadOnly to allow only read only accesses to the memory - writes will cause and access fault.<br>
	kIOMapReference will only succeed if the mapping already exists, and the IOMemoryMap object is just an extra reference, ie. no new mapping will be created.<br>
	kIOMapUnique allows a special kind of mapping to be created that may be used with the IOMemoryMap::redirect() API. These mappings will not be shared as is the default - there will always be a unique mapping created for the caller, not an existing mapping with an extra reference.<br>
    @param offset Is a beginning offset into the IOMemoryDescriptor's memory where the mapping starts. Zero is the default to map all the memory.
    @param length Is the length of the mapping requested for a subset of the IOMemoryDescriptor. Zero is the default to map all the memory.
    @result A reference to an IOMemoryMap object representing the mapping, which can supply the virtual address of the mapping and other information. The mapping may be shared with multiple callers - multiple maps are avoided if a compatible one exists. The IOMemoryMap object returned should be released only when the caller has finished accessing the mapping, as freeing the object destroys the mapping.
