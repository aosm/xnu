 * To support the lazy binding of undefined symbols in the dynamic link-editor,

 * made to the same symbol the non-lazy reference takes precedence.  A reference
 * is lazy only when all references to that symbol are made through a symbol
 * pointer in a lazy symbol pointer section.
 *
 * The implementation of marking nlist structures in the symbol table for
 * undefined symbols will be to use some of the bits of the n_desc field as a
 * reference type.  The mask REFERENCE_TYPE will be applied to the n_desc field
 * of an nlist structure for an undefined symbol to determine the type of
 * undefined reference (lazy or non-lazy).
 *
 * The constants for the REFERENCE FLAGS are propagated to the reference table
 * in a shared library file.  In that case the constant for a defined symbol,
 * REFERENCE_FLAG_DEFINED, is also used.
