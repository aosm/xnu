/*
 * When returning from interrupt/trap context to kernel mode,
 * the pending ASTs are masked with AST_URGENT to determine if
 * ast_taken(AST_PREEMPTION) should be called, for instance to
 * effect preemption of a kernel thread by a realtime thread.
 * This is also done when re-enabling preemption or re-enabling
 * interrupts, since an AST may have been set while preemption
 * was disabled, and it should take effect as soon as possible.
 *
 * When returning from interrupt/trap/syscall context to user
 * mode, any and all ASTs that are pending should be handled.
 *
 * If a thread context switches, only ASTs not in AST_PER_THREAD
 * remain active. The per-thread ASTs are stored in the thread_t
 * and re-enabled when the thread context switches back.
 *
 * Typically the preemption ASTs are set as a result of threads
 * becoming runnable, threads changing priority, or quantum
 * expiration. If a thread becomes runnable and is chosen
 * to run on another processor, cause_ast_check() may be called
 * to IPI that processor and request csw_check() be run there.
