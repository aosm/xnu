 *	(see below).
 */

/*
 *	A "simple" spin lock, providing non-blocking mutual
 *	exclusion and conditional acquisition.
 *
 *	The usimple_lock exists even in uniprocessor configurations.
 *	A data structure is always allocated for it and the following
 *	operations are always defined:
 *
 *		usimple_lock_init	lock initialization (mandatory!)
 *		usimple_lock		lock acquisition
 *		usimple_unlock		lock release
 *		usimple_lock_try	conditional lock acquisition;
 *					non-zero means success
 *      Simple lock DEBUG interfaces
 *		usimple_lock_held	verify lock already held by me
 *		usimple_lock_none_held	verify no usimple locks are held
 *
 *	The usimple_lock may be used for synchronization between
 *	thread context and interrupt context, or between a uniprocessor
 *	and an intelligent device.  Obviously, it may also be used for
 *	multiprocessor synchronization.  Its use should be rare; the
 *	simple_lock is the preferred spinning lock (see below).
 *
 *	The usimple_lock supports optional lock debugging and statistics.
 *
 *	Normally, we expect the usimple_lock data structure to be
 *	defined here, with its operations implemented in an efficient,
 *	machine-dependent way.  However, any implementation may choose
 *	to rely on a C-based, portable  version of the usimple_lock for
 *	debugging, statistics, and/or tracing.  Three hooks are used in
 *	the portable lock package to allow the machine-dependent package
 *	to override some or all of the portable package's features.
 *
 *	The usimple_lock also handles pre-emption.  Lock acquisition
 *	implies disabling pre-emption, while lock release implies
 *	re-enabling pre-emption.  Conditional lock acquisition does
 *	not assume success:  on success, pre-emption is disabled
 *	but on failure the pre-emption state remains the same as
 *	the pre-emption state before the acquisition attempt.
 */

 *	Each usimple_lock has a type, used for debugging and
 *	statistics.  This type may safely be ignored in a
 *	production configuration.

 *	should be the "most popular" spinning lock; the usimple_lock
 *	and hw_lock should only be used in rare cases.
