/*
 *	The Mach lock package exports the following simple lock abstractions:
 *
 *	Lock Type  Properties
 *	hw_lock	   lowest level hardware abstraction; atomic,
 *		   non-blocking, mutual exclusion; supports pre-emption
 *	usimple	   non-blocking spinning lock, available in all
 *		   kernel configurations; may be used from thread
 *		   and interrupt contexts; supports debugging,
 *		   statistics and pre-emption
 *	simple	   non-blocking spinning lock, intended for SMP
 *		   synchronization (vanishes on a uniprocessor);
 *		   supports debugging, statistics and pre-emption
 *
 *	NOTES TO IMPLEMENTORS:  there are essentially two versions
 *	of the lock package.  One is portable, written in C, and
 *	supports all of the various flavors of debugging, statistics,
 *	uni- versus multi-processor, pre-emption, etc.  The "other"
 *	is whatever set of lock routines is provided by machine-dependent
 *	code.  Presumably, the machine-dependent package is heavily
 *	optimized and meant for production kernels.
 *
 *	We encourage implementors to focus on highly-efficient,
 *	production implementations of machine-dependent lock code,
 *	and use the portable lock package for everything else.
 */

/*
 *	All of the remaining locking constructs may have two versions.
 *	One version is machine-independent, built in C on top of the
 *	hw_lock construct.  This version supports production, debugging
 *	and statistics configurations and is portable across architectures.
 *
 *	Any particular port may override some or all of the portable
 *	lock package for whatever reason -- usually efficiency.
 *
 *	The direct use of hw_locks by machine-independent Mach code
 *	should be rare; the preferred spinning lock is the simple_lock
 *	(see below).
 */

/*
 *	A "simple" spin lock, providing non-blocking mutual
 *	exclusion and conditional acquisition.
 *
 *	The usimple_lock exists even in uniprocessor configurations.
 *	A data structure is always allocated for it.
 *
 *	The usimple_lock may be used for synchronization between
 *	thread context and interrupt context, or between a uniprocessor
 *	and an intelligent device.  Obviously, it may also be used for
 *	multiprocessor synchronization.  Its use should be rare; the
 *	simple_lock is the preferred spinning lock (see below).
 *
 *	The usimple_lock supports optional lock debugging and statistics.
 *
 *	The usimple_lock may be inlined or optimized in ways that
 *	depend on the particular machine architecture and kernel
 *	build configuration; e.g., processor type, number of CPUs,
 *	production v. debugging.
 *
 *	Normally, we expect the usimple_lock data structure to be
 *	defined here, with its operations implemented in an efficient,
 *	machine-dependent way.  However, any implementation may choose
 *	to rely on a C-based, portable  version of the usimple_lock for
 *	debugging, statistics, and/or tracing.  Three hooks are used in
 *	the portable lock package to allow the machine-dependent package
 *	to override some or all of the portable package's features.
 *
 *	
 *      The usimple_lock data structure
 *	can be overriden in a machine-dependent way by defining
 *	LOCK_USIMPLE_DATA, although we expect this to be unnecessary.
 *	(Note that if you choose to override LOCK_USIMPLE_DATA, you'd
 *      better also be prepared to override LOCK_USIMPLE_CALLS.) 
 *
 *	The usimple_lock also handles pre-emption.  Lock acquisition
 *	implies disabling pre-emption, while lock release implies
 *	re-enabling pre-emption.  Conditional lock acquisition does
 *	not assume success:  on success, pre-emption is disabled
 *	but on failure the pre-emption state remains the same as
 *	the pre-emption state before the acquisition attempt.

 *	This structure records additional information about lock state
 *	and recent operations.  The data are carefully organized so that
 *	some portions of it can be examined BEFORE actually acquiring
 *	the lock -- for instance, the lock_thread field, to detect an
 *	attempt to acquire a lock already owned by the calling thread.
 *	All *updates* to this structure are governed by the lock to which
 *	this structure belongs.
 *
 *	Note cache consistency dependency:  being able to examine some
 *	of the fields in this structure without first acquiring a lock
 *	implies strongly-ordered cache coherency OR release consistency.
 *	Perhaps needless to say, acquisition consistency may not suffice.
 *	However, it's hard to imagine a scenario using acquisition
 *	consistency that results in using stale data from this structure.
 *	It would be necessary for the thread manipulating the lock to
 *	switch to another processor without first executing any instructions
 *	that would cause the needed consistency updates; basically, without
 *	taking a lock.  Not possible in this kernel!

 *	Upon the usimple_lock we define the simple_lock, which
 *	exists for SMP configurations.  These locks aren't needed
 *	in a uniprocessor configuration, so compile-time tricks
 *	make them disappear when NCPUS==1.  (For debugging purposes,
 *	however, they can be enabled even on a uniprocessor.)  This
 *	should be the "most popular" spinning lock; the usimple_lock
 *	and hw_lock should only be used in rare cases.
 *
 *	IMPORTANT:  simple_locks that may be shared between interrupt
 *	and thread context must have their use coordinated with spl.
 *	The spl level must alway be the same when acquiring the lock.
 *	Otherwise, deadlock may result.
 *
 *	Given that, in some configurations, Mach does not need to
 *	allocate simple_lock data structures, users of simple_locks
 *	should employ the "decl_simple_lock_data" macro when allocating
 *	simple_locks.  Note that it use should be something like
 *		decl_simple_lock_data(static,foo_lock)
 *	WITHOUT any terminating semi-colon.  Because the macro expands
 *	to include its own semi-colon, if one is needed, it may safely
 *	be used multiple times at arbitrary positions within a structure.
 *	Adding a semi-colon will cause structure definitions to fail
 *	when locks are turned off and a naked semi-colon is left behind.

 *	If the machine-dependent code has turned on LOCK_SIMPLE_DATA,
 *	then it assumes all responsibility.  Otherwise, we need
 *	these data structures if the configuration includes SMP or
 *	lock debugging or statistics.
 *
 *	N.B.  Simple locks should be declared using
 *		decl_simple_lock_data(class,name)
 *	with no trailing semi-colon.  This syntax works best because
 *		- it correctly disappears in production uniprocessor
 *		  configurations, leaving behind no allocated data
 *		  structure
 *		- it can handle static and extern declarations:
 *			decl_simple_lock_data(extern,foo)	extern
 *			decl_simple_lock_data(static,foo)	static
 *			decl_simple_lock_data(,foo)		ordinary
