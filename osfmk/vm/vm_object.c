/*
 *	Virtual memory objects maintain the actual data
 *	associated with allocated virtual memory.  A given
 *	page of memory exists within exactly one object.
 *
 *	An object is only deallocated when all "references"
 *	are given up.
 *
 *	Associated with each object is a list of all resident
 *	memory pages belonging to that object; this list is
 *	maintained by the "vm_page" module, but locked by the object's
 *	lock.
 *
 *	Each object also records the memory object reference
 *	that is used by the kernel to request and write
 *	back data (the memory object, field "pager"), etc...
 *
 *	Virtual memory objects are allocated to provide
 *	zero-filled memory (vm_allocate) or map a user-defined
 *	memory object into a virtual address space (vm_map).
 *
 *	Virtual memory objects that refer to a user-defined
 *	memory object are called "permanent", because all changes
 *	made in virtual memory are reflected back to the
 *	memory manager, which may then store it permanently.
 *	Other virtual memory objects are called "temporary",
 *	meaning that changes need be written back only when
 *	necessary to reclaim pages, and that storage associated
 *	with the object can be discarded once it is no longer
 *	mapped.
 *
 *	A permanent memory object may be mapped into more
 *	than one virtual address space.  Moreover, two threads
 *	may attempt to make the first mapping of a memory
 *	object concurrently.  Only one thread is allowed to
 *	complete this mapping; all others wait for the
 *	"pager_initialized" field is asserted, indicating
 *	that the first thread has initialized all of the
 *	necessary fields in the virtual memory object structure.
 *
 *	The kernel relies on a *default memory manager* to
 *	provide backing storage for the zero-filled virtual
 *	memory objects.  The pager memory objects associated
 *	with these temporary virtual memory objects are only
 *	requested from the default memory manager when it
 *	becomes necessary.  Virtual memory objects
 *	that depend on the default memory manager are called
 *	"internal".  The "pager_created" field is provided to
 *	indicate whether these ports have ever been allocated.
 *	
 *	The kernel may also create virtual memory objects to
 *	hold changed pages after a copy-on-write operation.
 *	In this case, the virtual memory object (and its
 *	backing storage -- its memory object) only contain
 *	those pages that have been changed.  The "shadow"
 *	field refers to the virtual memory object that contains
 *	the remainder of the contents.  The "shadow_offset"
 *	field indicates where in the "shadow" these contents begin.
 *	The "copy" field refers to a virtual memory object
 *	to which changed pages must be copied before changing
 *	this object, in order to implement another form
 *	of copy-on-write optimization.
 *
 *	The virtual memory object structure also records
 *	the attributes associated with its memory object.
 *	The "pager_ready", "can_persist" and "copy_strategy"
 *	fields represent those attributes.  The "cached_list"
 *	field is used in the implementation of the persistence
 *	attribute.

	 *		Record the original object as the backing object for

	 *		 When the original mapping causes a page to be modified,
	 *		 it must be copied to a new page that is "pushed" to
	 *		 the copy object.
	 *		Mark the new mapping (the copy object) copy-on-write.
	 *		 This makes the copy object itself read-only, allowing
	 *		 it to be reused if the original mapping makes no
	 *		 changes, and simplifying the synchronization required
	 *		 in the "push" operation described above.
	 *
	 *	The copy-on-write is said to be assymetric because the original
	 *	object is *not* marked copy-on-write. A copied page is pushed
	 *	to the copy object, regardless which party attempted to modify
	 *	the page.
	 *
	 *	Repeated asymmetric copy operations may be done. If the
	 *	original object has not been changed since the last copy, its
	 *	copy object can be reused. Otherwise, a new copy object can be
	 *	inserted between the original object and its previous copy
	 *	object.  Since any copy object is read-only, this cannot affect
	 *	affect the contents of the previous copy object.
	 *
	 *	Note that a copy object is higher in the object tree than the

 *			the user requesting a mapping (or the kernel,
 *			when initializing internal objects); the
 *			kernel simulates holding send rights by keeping
 *			a port reference;
 *
 *		pager_request:
 *			the memory object control port,
 *			created by the kernel; the kernel holds
 *			receive (and ownership) rights to this
 *			port, but no other references.
 *
 *	When initialization is complete, the "initialized" field
 *	is asserted.  Other mappings using a particular memory object,
 *	and any references to the vm_object gained through the
 *	port association must wait for this initialization to occur.
 *
 *	In order to allow the memory manager to set attributes before
 *	requests (notably virtual copy operations, but also data or
 *	unlock requests) are made, a "ready" attribute is made available.
 *	Only the memory manager may affect the value of this attribute.
 *	Its value does not affect critical kernel functions, such as
 *	internal object initialization or destruction.  [Furthermore,
 *	memory objects created by the kernel are assumed to be ready
 *	immediately; the default memory manager need not explicitly
 *	set the "ready" attribute.]
 *
 *	[Both the "initialized" and "ready" attribute wait conditions
 *	use the "pager" field as the wait event.]
 *
 *	The port associations can be broken down by any of the
 *	following routines:
 *		vm_object_terminate:
 *			No references to the vm_object remain, and
 *			the object cannot (or will not) be cached.
 *			This is the normal case, and is done even
 *			though one of the other cases has already been
 *			done.
 *		memory_object_destroy:
 *			The memory manager has requested that the
 *			kernel relinquish references to the memory
 *			object. [The memory manager may not want to
 *			destroy the memory object, but may wish to
 *			refuse or tear down existing memory mappings.]
 *
 *	Each routine that breaks an association must break all of
 *	them at once.  At some later time, that routine must clear
 *	the pager field and release the memory object references.
 *	[Furthermore, each routine must cope with the simultaneous
 *	or previous operations of the others.]
 *
 *	In addition to the lock on the object, the vm_object_cache_lock
 *	governs the associations.  References gained through the
 *	association require use of the cache lock.
 *
 *	Because the pager field may be cleared spontaneously, it
 *	cannot be used to determine whether a memory object has
 *	ever been associated with a particular vm_object.  [This
 *	knowledge is important to the shadow object mechanism.]
 *	For this reason, an additional "created" attribute is
 *	provided.
 *
 *	During various paging operations, the pager reference found in the
 *	vm_object must be valid.  To prevent this from being released,
 *	(other than being removed, i.e., made null), routines may use
 *	the vm_object_paging_begin/end routines [actually, macros].
 *	The implementation uses the "paging_in_progress" and "wanted" fields.
 *	[Operations that alter the validity of the pager values include the
 *	termination routines and vm_object_collapse.]

/*
 * vm_object_purgable_control() allows the caller to control and investigate the
 * state of a purgable object.  A purgable object is created via a call to
 * vm_allocate() with VM_FLAGS_PURGABLE specified.  A purgable object will
 * never be coalesced with any other object -- even other purgable objects --
 * and will thus always remain a distinct object.  A purgable object has
 * special semantics when its reference count is exactly 1.  If its reference
 * count is greater than 1, then a purgable object will behave like a normal
 * object and attempts to use this interface will result in an error return
 * of KERN_INVALID_ARGUMENT.
 *
 * A purgable object may be put into a "volatile" state which will make the
 * object's pages elligable for being reclaimed without paging to backing
 * store if the system runs low on memory.  If the pages in a volatile
 * purgable object are reclaimed, the purgable object is said to have been
 * "emptied."  When a purgable object is emptied the system will reclaim as
 * many pages from the object as it can in a convenient manner (pages already
 * en route to backing store or busy for other reasons are left as is).  When
 * a purgable object is made volatile, its pages will generally be reclaimed
 * before other pages in the application's working set.  This semantic is
 * generally used by applications which can recreate the data in the object
 * faster than it can be paged in.  One such example might be media assets
 * which can be reread from a much faster RAID volume.
 *
 * A purgable object may be designated as "non-volatile" which means it will
 * behave like all other objects in the system with pages being written to and
 * read from backing store as needed to satisfy system memory needs.  If the
 * object was emptied before the object was made non-volatile, that fact will
 * be returned as the old state of the purgable object (see
 * VM_PURGABLE_SET_STATE below).  In this case, any pages of the object which
 * were reclaimed as part of emptying the object will be refaulted in as
 * zero-fill on demand.  It is up to the application to note that an object
 * was emptied and recreate the objects contents if necessary.  When a
 * purgable object is made non-volatile, its pages will generally not be paged
 * out to backing store in the immediate future.  A purgable object may also
 * be manually emptied.
 *
 * Finally, the current state (non-volatile, volatile, volatile & empty) of a
 * volatile purgable object may be queried at any time.  This information may
 * be used as a control input to let the application know when the system is
 * experiencing memory pressure and is reclaiming memory.
 *
 * The specified address may be any address within the purgable object.  If
 * the specified address does not represent any object in the target task's
 * virtual address space, then KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS will be returned.  If the
 * object containing the specified address is not a purgable object, then
 * KERN_INVALID_ARGUMENT will be returned.  Otherwise, KERN_SUCCESS will be
 * returned.
 *
 * The control parameter may be any one of VM_PURGABLE_SET_STATE or
 * VM_PURGABLE_GET_STATE.  For VM_PURGABLE_SET_STATE, the in/out parameter
 * state is used to set the new state of the purgable object and return its
 * old state.  For VM_PURGABLE_GET_STATE, the current state of the purgable
 * object is returned in the parameter state.
 *
 * The in/out parameter state may be one of VM_PURGABLE_NONVOLATILE,
 * VM_PURGABLE_VOLATILE or VM_PURGABLE_EMPTY.  These, respectively, represent
 * the non-volatile, volatile and volatile/empty states described above.
 * Setting the state of a purgable object to VM_PURGABLE_EMPTY will
 * immediately reclaim as many pages in the object as can be conveniently
 * collected (some may have already been written to backing store or be
 * otherwise busy).
 *
 * The process of making a purgable object non-volatile and determining its
 * previous state is atomic.  Thus, if a purgable object is made
 * VM_PURGABLE_NONVOLATILE and the old state is returned as
 * VM_PURGABLE_VOLATILE, then the purgable object's previous contents are
 * completely intact and will remain so until the object is made volatile
 * again.  If the old state is returned as VM_PURGABLE_EMPTY then the object
 * was reclaimed while it was in a volatile state and its previous contents
 * have been lost.
