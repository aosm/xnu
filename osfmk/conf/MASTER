#	Master machine independent configuration file.
#
#	Specific configuration files are created based on this and
#	the machine specific master file using the doconf script.
#
#	Any changes to the master configuration files will affect all
#	other configuration files based upon it.
#
#######################################################################
#
#	To build a configuration, execute "doconf <configuration>."
#	Configurations are specified in the "Configurations:" section
#	of the MASTER and MASTER.* files as follows:
#
#	<configuration> = [ <attribute0> <attribute1> ... <attributeN> ]
#
#	Lines in the MASTER and MASTER.* files are selected based on
#	the attribute selector list, found in a comment at the end of
#	the line.  This is a list of attributes separated by commas.
#	The "!" operator selects the line if none of the attributes are
#	specified.
#
#	For example:
#
#	<foo,bar>	selects a line if "foo" or "bar" are specified.
#	<!foo,bar>	selects a line if neither "foo" nor "bar" is
#			specified.
#
#	Lines with no attributes specified are selected for all
#	configurations.

# Basic compilation options.
#
# The MACH ident is passed to every kernel file compilation as -DMACH.
#	This is useful in order to #ifdef code that is intended to be used in
#	a MACH kernel.

# conf/config.debug
#
# This defines configuration options that are normally used only during
# kernel code development and debugging. They add run-time error checks or
# statistics gathering, which will slow down the system
#
##########################################################
#
# MACH_ASSERT controls the assert() and ASSERT() macros, used to verify the
#	consistency of various algorithms in the kernel. The performance impact
#	of this option is significant.
#
options		MACH_ASSERT	#		# <debug>
#
# MACH_DEBUG enables the mach_debug_server, a message interface used to
#	retrieve or control various statistics. This interface may expose data
#	structures that would not normally be allowed outside the kernel, and
#	MUST NOT be enabled on a released configuration.
#	Other options here enable information retrieval for specific subsystems
#
options		MACH_DEBUG	#		#
#
options		MACH_IPC_DEBUG	#		# <debug>
options		MACH_VM_DEBUG	#		# <debug>
#
# MACH_MP_DEBUG control the possible dead locks that may occur by controlling
#	that IPL level has been raised down to SPL0 after some calls to
#	hardclock device driver.
#
options		MACH_MP_DEBUG	#		# <debug>
#
# ZONE_DEBUG keeps track of all zalloc()ed elements to perform further
#	operations on each element.
#
options		ZONE_DEBUG	#		# <debug>
# 
# XPR_DEBUG enables the gathering of data through the XPR macros inserted
#	into various subsystems. This option is normally only enabled for
#	specific performance or behavior studies, as the overhead in both
#	code and data space is large. The data is normally retrieved through
#	the kernel debugger (kdb) or by reading /dev/kmem.
#	
options		XPR_DEBUG	#		# <debug>
# 
# MACH_LDEBUG controls the internal consistency checks and
#	data gathering in the locking package. This also enables a debug-only
#	version of simple-locks on uniprocessor machines. The code size and
#	performance impact of this option is significant.
# 
options		MACH_LDEBUG	#		# <debug>

# MACH_COUNTERS enables code that handles various counters in the system.
# 
options		MACH_COUNTERS	#		# <debug>
#
# ETAP	The Event Trace Analysis Package enables user-level tasks to monitor
#	and analyze kernel events.  ETAP supports three modes of tracing:
#
#		1. General event tracing:	ETAP_EVENT_MONITOR
#		2. Monitored lock tracing:	ETAP_LOCK_MONITOR
#		3. Cumulative lock tracing:	ETAP_LOCK_ACCUMULATE
#
#	Each of these trace modes are mutually exclusive.
#
#	CONFIGURING ETAP:  To enable the trace package, the ETAP switch
#	along with *ONE* ETAP trace mode is selected.  The selected ETAP
#	mode determines the level of instrumentation built into the kernel.
#	Mode 1 configures event probes through-out the system.	Modes 2 & 3
#	add instumentation to the kernel lock mechanisms.
#
#	ETAP (and all its trace modes) is mutually exclusive with the
#	MACH_LDEBUG option.  It is assumed that general lock debugging is
#	completed before gathering event information.
#
#	ETAP functionality is normally only enabled for event profiling and
#	performance studies.  Event tracing should not be enabled for release
#	configurations, as the code size and performance impact of these
#	options are significant.
#
#
#options	ETAP			# ETAP enable
#options	ETAP_EVENT_MONITOR	# Monitor events
#options	ETAP_LOCK_MONITOR	# Monitor lock behavior
#options	ETAP_LOCK_ACCUMULATE	# Collect cumulative lock data
