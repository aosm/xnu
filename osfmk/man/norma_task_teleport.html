The child task acquires shared parts of the parent'saddress space (see vm_inherit) regardless of the inheritance set forthe parent's memory regions, although the inheritance for thechild's regions will be set to that of the parent's regions. The childtask initially contains no threads. The parent_task is thenterminated.By way of comparison, tasks created by the standard task_createprimitive are created on the same node as the parent.Other than being created on a different node, the new task has thesame properties as if created by task_create.<h3>NOTES</h3><p>This call differs from norma_task_clone in that the parent task isterminated as part of the teleport call.This call differs from norma_task_create in that the inheritance setfor the parent's memory regions is ignored; the child always sharesmemory with the parent.This call is intended to support process migration, where theinheritance semantics of norma_task_create would break migratedprograms that depended upon sharing relationships remaining aftermigration.This call is not a true task migration call, in that it does notmigrate the port space, threads, and other non-address-spaceattributes of the task.<h3>RETURN VALUES</h3><p>Only generic errors apply.<h3>RELATED INFORMATION</h3><p>Functions:<a href="norma_task_clone.html"><strong>norma_task_clone</strong></a>,<a href="task_create.html"><strong>task_create</strong></a>,<a href="norma_task_create.html"><strong>norma_task_create</strong></a>,
