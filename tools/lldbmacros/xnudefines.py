""" This file holds all static values that debugging macros need. These are typically object type strings, #defines in C etc.
    The objective is to provide a single place to be the bridge between C code in xnu and the python macros used by lldb.
    If you define a variable which has been copied/referred over from C code and has high chance of changing over time. It would
    be best to define a supporting function of format "populate_<variable_name>". This will help in running them to repopulate.
     
    Please take a look at example of kobject_types below before making changes to this file.
    Note: The Format of the function has to be populate_<variable_name> so that the automated updating will pick it up.
