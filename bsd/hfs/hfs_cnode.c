 * hfs_cnode_teardown
 *
 * This is an internal function that is invoked from both hfs_vnop_inactive
 * and hfs_vnop_reclaim.  As VNOP_INACTIVE is not necessarily called from vnodes
 * being recycled and reclaimed, it is important that we do any post-processing
 * necessary for the cnode in both places.  Important tasks include things such as
 * releasing the blocks from an open-unlinked file when all references to it have dropped,
 * and handling resource forks separately from data forks.
 *
 * Note that we take only the vnode as an argument here (rather than the cnode).
 * Recall that each cnode supports two forks (rsrc/data), and we can always get the right
 * cnode from either of the vnodes, but the reverse is not true -- we can't determine which
 * vnode we need to reclaim if only the cnode is supplied. 
 *
 * This function is idempotent and safe to call from both hfs_vnop_inactive and hfs_vnop_reclaim
 * if both are invoked right after the other.  In the second call, most of this function's if()
 * conditions will fail, since they apply generally to cnodes still marked with C_DELETED.  
 * As a quick check to see if this function is necessary, determine if the cnode is already
 * marked C_NOEXISTS.  If it is, then it is safe to skip this function.  The only tasks that 
 * remain for cnodes marked in such a fashion is to teardown their fork references and 
 * release all directory hints and hardlink origins.  However, both of those are done 
 * in hfs_vnop_reclaim.  hfs_update, by definition, is not necessary if the cnode's catalog
 * entry is no longer there.  
 *
 * 'reclaim' argument specifies whether or not we were called from hfs_vnop_reclaim.  If we are
 * invoked from hfs_vnop_reclaim, we can not call functions that cluster_push since the UBC info 
 * is totally gone by that point.
 *
 * Assumes that both truncate and cnode locks for 'cp' are held.
