.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions are designed to copy contiguous data from one address
to another.  All but
.Fn copystr
copy data from user-space to kernel-space or vice-versa.
.Pp
The
.Nm
routines provide the following functionality:
.Bl -tag -width "copyoutstr()"
.\" ========
.It Fn copyin
Copies
.Pa len
bytes of data from the user-space address
.Pa uaddr
to the kernel-space address
.Pa kaddr .
.\" ========
.It Fn copyinstr
Copies a NUL-terminated string, at most
.Pa len
bytes long, from user-space address
.Pa uaddr
to kernel-space address
.Pa kaddr .
The number of bytes actually copied, including the terminating
NUL, is returned in
.Pa *done .
.\" ========
.It Fn copyout
Copies
.Pa len
bytes of data from the kernel-space address
.Pa kaddr
to the user-space address
.Pa uaddr .
.\" ========
.\" .It Fn copyoutstr
.\" Copies a NUL-terminated string, at most
.\" bytes long, from kernel-space address
.\" .Pa kaddr
.\" to user-space address
.\" .Pa uaddr .
.\" The number of bytes actually copied, including the terminating
.\" NUL, is returned in
.\" .Pa *done .
.\" ========
.It Fn copystr
Copies a NUL-terminated string, at most
.Pa len
bytes long, from kernel-space address
.Pa kfaddr
to kernel-space address
.Pa kdaddr .
The number of bytes actually copied, including the terminating
NUL, is returned in
.Pa *done .
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
functions return 0 on success or
.Er EFAULT
if a bad address is encountered.
In addition, the
.Fn copystr ,
and
.Fn copyinstr
.\" .Fn copyinstr ,
.\" and
.\" .Fn copyoutstr
functions return
.Er ENAMETOOLONG
if the string is longer than
.Pa len
bytes.
