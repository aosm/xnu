.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose
function adds a close operation to the list of operations associated with
the object referenced by
.Em file_actions ,
for subsequent use in a call to
.Xr posix_spawn 2
or 
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 .
The descriptor referred to by
.Em filedes
is closed as if
.Fn close
had been called on it prior to the new child process
starting execution.
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen
function adds an open operation to the list of operations associated with
the object referenced by
.Em file_actions ,
for subsequent use in a call to
.Xr posix_spawn 2
or 
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 .
The descriptor referred to by
.Em filedes
is opened using the
.Em path ,
.Em oflag ,
and
.Em mode
arguments as if
.Fn open
had been called on it prior to the new child process
starting execution.  The string
.Em path
is copied by the
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen
function during this process, so storage need not be persistent in the
caller.
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2
function adds a dup2 operation to the list of operations associated with
the object referenced by
.Em file_actions ,
for subsequent use in a call to
.Xr posix_spawn 2
or 
.Xr posix_spawnp 2 .
The descriptor referred to by
.Em newfiledes
is created as if
.Fn dup2
had been called on
.Em filedes
prior to the new child process starting execution.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, these functions return 0; on failure they return an error
number from
.In errno.h .
.Sh ERRORS
These functions may fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.\" ==========
.It Bq Er EBADF
The value specified by
.Fa filedes
is negative or would cause the process to exceed the maximum number of
open files it is allowed..
.\" ==========
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value of
.Fa file_actions
is invalid.
.\" ==========
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Insufficient memory was available eo add to the
.Fa file_actions .
