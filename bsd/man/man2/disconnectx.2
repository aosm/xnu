.Dt DISCONNECTX 2
.Os Darwin
.Sh NAME
.Nm disconnectx
.Nd disconnects a connection on a socket
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/socket.h>
.Ft int
.Fo disconnectx
.Fa "int socket"
.Fa "associd_t associd"
.Fa "connid_t connid"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The parameter
.Fa socket
is a socket.  The communication domain of the socket determines the
availability and behavior of
.Fn disconnectx .
In general,
.Fn disconnectx
is analogous to
.Xr shutdown 2
.Dv with SHUT_RDWR
issued on the connection identified by
.Fa connid ,
or on all connections associated with the
.Fa associd
association.
.Pp
The parameter
.Fa associd
specifies the association identifier.  It may be set to
.Dv ASSOCID_ANY
when there is only one association present;
.Dv ASSOCID_ALL
to specify all existing associations; or one of the identifiers returned from
.Xr getassocids 3 .
.Pp
The parameter
.Fa connid
specifies the connection identifier.  It may be set to
.Dv CONNID_ANY
or
.Dv CONNID_ALL ,
in which case the association represented by
.Fa associd
will be dissolved; or the value returned from
.Xr connectx 2
or
.Xr getconnids 3 ,
which indicates that the disconnection occurs only on that connection
while keeping the session association intact.  For the latter, the connection
associated with
.Fa connid
will no longer be valid upon success.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn disconnectx
function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the value of -1 is
returned and the global integer variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn disconnectx
system call succeeds unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EALREADY
Operation already in progress for the session association represented by
.Fa associd .
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EBADF
.Fa Socket
is not a valid descriptor.
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa associd
or
.Fa connid
argument is invalid or the underlying protocol is no longer attached to
.Fa socket .
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er ENOTCONN
The session association repreresented by
.Fa associd
is not connected.
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er ENOTSOCK
.Fa Socket
is a file, not a socket.
