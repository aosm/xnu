1. Investiate making ISOFS another UFS shared filesystem (ala FFS/MFS/LFS).
   Since it was modelled after the inode code, we might be able to merge
   them back.  It looks like a seperate (but very similar) lookup routine
   will be needed due to the associated file stuff.

2. Seems like there should be a "notrans" or some such mount option to show
   filenames as they really are without lower-casing.  Does this make sense?
