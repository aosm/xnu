 *
 * A process is initially started out with NDFILE descriptors [XXXstored within

 * the historical limit of 20 open files (and the usage of descriptors by
 * shells).  If these descriptors are exhausted, a larger descriptor table
 * may be allocated, up to a process' resource limit; [XXXthe internal arrays
 * are then unusedXXX].  The initial expansion is set to NDEXTENT; each time
 * it runs out, it is doubled until the resource limit is reached. NDEXTENT
 * should be selected to be the biggest multiple of OFILESIZE (see below)
