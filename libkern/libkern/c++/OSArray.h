    @abstract A collection class whose instances maintain a list of object references.
    @discussion
    An instance of an OSArray is a mutable collection which maintains a list of references to OSMetaClassBase derived objects.  Objects are referenced by index, where the index is an integer with a value of 0 to N-1 where N is the number of objects contained within the array.
    
    Objects placed into an array are automatically retained and objects removed or replaced are automatically released. All objects are released when the array is freed.
