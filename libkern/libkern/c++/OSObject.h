    @class OSObject : OSMetaClassBase
    @abstract The root base class for Mac OS X kernel and just generally all-round useful class to have around.
    @discussion
Defines the minimum functionality that an object can expect.  Implements reference counting, type safe object casting, allocation primitives & serialisation among other functionality.	 This object is an abstract base class and can not be copied, nor can it be constructed by itself.

<br><br> Construction <br><br>

As Mac OS X's C++ is based upon Embedded C++ we have a problem with the typical C++ method of using constructors.  Embedded C++ does not allow exceptions.  This means that the standard constructors can not report a failure.  Well obviously initialisation of a new object can fail so we have had to work around this language limitation.  In the Mac OS X kernel we have chosen to break object construction into two phases.  Phase one is the familiar C++ new operator, the only initialisation is the object has exactly one reference after creation.  Once the new is called the client MUST call init and check it's return value.  If the init call fails then the object MUST be immediately released.  IOKit usually implements factory methods to make construction a one step process for clients.  

<br><br>Reference Counting<br><br>

OSObject provides reference counting services using the $link retain(), $link release(), $link release(int when) and $link free() functions.  The public interface to the reference counting is retain() & release().  release() is implemented as a simple call to release(1).  The actual implementation of release(when) is a little subtle.  If the current reference count is less than or equal to the 'when' parameter the object will call free on itself.  
<br>
In general a subclass is expected to only override $link free().  It may also choose to override release() if the object has a circular retain count, see $link release(int when);

<br><br>Runtime Type Information System<br><br>

The Mac OS X C++ implements a basic runtime type information system using meta class information and a number of macros, $link OSDynamicCast, $link OSTypeID, $link OSTypeIDInst, $link OSCheckTypeInst and $link OSMetaClass.

An example of this sort of problem is a parent/child mutual reference, either the parent or child can implement: void taggedRelease(tag) { taggedRelease(tag, 2); } thus breaking the cirularity.
