// data points to the base address of the via and two longs
// for storing the via and dec results.
//
// The basic idea is this...
// Use the counter register to execute a loop that will take
// 10,000,000 processor clocks.  Time it using both the via counter
// and the time base.  Return the number of ticks for both so the
// raw values for processor and bus speed can be calculated.
